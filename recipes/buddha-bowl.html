            <li>2 c cooked brown rice</li>
            <li>1 c shredded carrots</li>
            <li>2 c spinach leaves</li>
            <li>2 c broccoli florets</li>
            <li>2 tsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 c chickpeas (drained, rinsed)</li>
            <li>16 extra firm tofu (pressed, drained)</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Peanut Sauce</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1-2 tbsp toasted sesame oil</li>
            <li>1/4 c low sodium soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 c 100% pure maple syrup</li>
            <li>2 tsp chili garlic sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 c peanut butter</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Cube tofu and place in a single layer on a non-stick baking sheet and cook for 25 minutes. If you arenâ€™t using a non-stick baking sheet, lightly spray with cooking spray. Remove from oven and place in a shallow bowl.</li>
            <li>Whisk together the ingredients for the sauce (sesame oil, soy sauce, maple syrup, chili garlic sauce, peanut butter) until creamy and smooth. Add 1/2 of the sauce to the tofu bowl and let marinate while you prepare the rest of the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Toss the broccoli with 1 teaspoon sesame or olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper. Place in the oven and roast for 20 minutes until just tender.</li>
            <li>Heat remaining olive or sesame oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add tofu, in batches, along with the marinating sauce until crispy and golden browned, about 3-4 minutes.</li>
            <li>To assemble, divide the brown rice among 4 bowls, top each bowl with 1/4 cup shredded carrots, 1/2 cup spinach leaves, 1/4th broccoli, 1/4 cup garbanzo beans and a few pieces of tofu. Drizzle with remaining peanut sauce.</li>
